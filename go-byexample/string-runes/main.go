// A Go string is a read-only slice of bytes. The language and the standard library treat strings specially - as containers of text encoded in UTF-8. In other languages, strings are made of ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù. In Go, the concept of a character is called a rune - it‚Äôs an integer that represents a Unicode code point. This Go blog post is a good introduction to the topic.

//Since strings are equivalent to []byte, this will produce the length of the raw bytes stored within

// Indexing into a string produces the raw byte values at each index. This loop generates the hex values of all the bytes that constitute the code points in s.

	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%d ", a[i])
	}

	fmt.Println()

		for i, w := 0, 0; i < len(a); i += w
		i is the byte index into the string (not character index).
		w is the width in bytes of the last rune.
		After each iteration, i += w moves i forward by the number of bytes in the last rune.
		This ensures you're stepping over each complete UTF-8 character, regardless of its byte size (1‚Äì4 bytes).

		üß† utf8.DecodeRuneInString(a[i:])
		This decodes the next rune (Unicode code point) starting at index i.
		It returns:
		runeValue ‚Üí the actual rune
		width ‚Üí the number of bytes this rune occupies
		Example:
		For the string "Swagat":

		Each ASCII character like S, w, a, etc. is 1 byte wide in UTF-8. So:

		On first iteration: i = 0, a[0:] = "Swagat", runeValue = 'S', width = 1
		Then i += 1 ‚Üí i = 1, decode 'w', and so on.
		If the string had multi-byte Unicode characters (like emojis or characters from Hindi, Japanese, etc.), the width would be >1 and the loop would still work perfectly.

		üñ®Ô∏è fmt.Printf("%#U starts at %d\n", runeValue, i)
		%#U formats the rune as U+XXXX 'char', e.g., U+0053 'S'
		i shows the starting byte index of the rune in the original string

		runeValue, width := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(a[i:])
		fmt.Printf("%#U starts at %d\n", runeValue, i)
		w = width

		examineRune(runeValue)
