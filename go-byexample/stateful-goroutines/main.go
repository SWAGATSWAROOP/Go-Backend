// In the previous example we used explicit locking with mutexes to synchronize access to shared state across multiple goroutines. Another option is to use the built-in synchronization features of goroutines and channels to achieve the same result. This channel-based approach aligns with Go’s ideas of sharing memory by communicating and having each piece of data owned by exactly 1 goroutine.

type readOp struct {
	key  int
	resp chan int
}

type writeOp struct {
	key  int
	val  int
	resp chan bool
}

// In this example our state will be owned by a single goroutine. This will guarantee that the data is never corrupted with concurrent access. In order to read or write that state, other goroutines will send messages to the owning goroutine and receive corresponding replies. These readOp and writeOp structs encapsulate those requests and a way for the owning goroutine to respond.

func main() {
	// As before we’ll count how many operations we perform
	var readOps uint64
	var writeOps uint64

	// The reads and writes channels will be used by other goroutines to issue read and write requests, respectively.
	reads := make(chan readOp)
	writes := make(chan writeOp)

	// Here is the goroutine that owns the state, which is a map as in the previous example but now private to the stateful goroutine. This goroutine repeatedly selects on the reads and writes channels, responding to requests as they arrive. A response is executed by first performing the requested operation and then sending a value on the response channel resp to indicate success (and the desired value in the case of reads).
	go func() {
		var state = make(map[int]int)
		for {
			select {
			case read := <-reads:
				read.resp <- state[read.key]
			case write := <-writes:
				state[write.key] = write.val
				write.resp <- true
			}
		}
	}()

	for r := 0; r < 100; r++ {
		go func() {
			for {
				read := readOp{
					key:  rand.Intn(5),
					resp: make(chan int)}
				reads <- read
				<-read.resp
				atomic.AddUint64(&readOps, 1)
				time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)
			}
		}()
	}

		go func() {

				write := writeOp{
					key:  rand.Intn(5),
					val:  rand.Intn(100),
					resp: make(chan bool)}
				writes <- write

				time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)
