/*
This WaitGroup is used to wait for all the goroutines launched here to finish. Note: if a WaitGroup is explicitly passed into functions, it should be done by pointer.
Wrap the worker call in a closure that makes sure to tell the WaitGroup that this worker is done. This way the worker itself does not have to be aware of the concurrency primitives involved in its execution.

Note that this approach has no straightforward way to propagate errors from workers. For more advanced use cases, consider using the errgroup package.
